This is a simple yet functional BBS for AX.25/packet radio/HAM setups.

It has:
* mail
* call other systems
* multi user chat

To configure, edit the top of bbs.py. To run, start bbs.py. You need
to install https://github.com/mfncooper/pyham_ax25 first.
Make sure to at least edit the 'callsign' variable to your own call-
sign and don't forget to include the ssid (e.g. -1).
